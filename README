per-buffer-theme.el
===================
Change theme and font according to active buffer name or major mode.

*per-buffer-theme.el* is an Emacs library that automatically changes
the global theme and frame font according to buffer name or major mode.

Run the command *per-buffer-theme-mode* to toggle the minor-mode which
enables o disables the package.

If buffer name matches any of *per-buffer-theme-ignored-buffernames-regex*
no theme or font change occurs.

Customizable variable *per-buffer-theme-themes-alist* contains the
association between themes and buffer name or major modes.

Special *notheme* theme name can be used to force the unload all themes
and use Emacs default theme.

If there aren't any matches then it will load the theme stored in
*per-buffer-theme-default-theme* variable and the font stored in
*per-buffer-theme-default-font* variable, or the default font.

There are two different methods in which buffer and theme can be checked.
It is controlled by customizable boolean *per-buffer-theme-use-timer*:

- 't' will use a timer, triggered every *per-buffer-theme-timer-idle-delay*
  seconds.  This is the default as it works smoothly.
  If it slows down Emacs a bit choose a bigger delay value.

- 'nil' uses a function advice to *select-window* so it could introduce
  some Emacs windows flickering when switching buffers due to how
  *select-window* internally works.
